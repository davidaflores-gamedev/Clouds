Greeting Space Cadet, befor eyou begin playing the game, there are a few things that you should know,
Building the Game
	Building the game should be the same as building any othe rgame, there is nothing special you have to do other than simply hitting the build key.

Running the Game
	By opening the software application, the game should run normally.
Controls
	In order to control your ship, you must use "s" and "f" to turn the ship and "e" to thrust in the forward direction. You may also use "SpaceBar" to fire bullets
	There are a few debugger keys as well such as "i" for spawning in new asteroids as well as "f1" to to turn on debug draw and lastly "f8" to restart the game. You may also use "p" to pause the game, "o" to run 1 frame, and "t" to slow down time in the game.
